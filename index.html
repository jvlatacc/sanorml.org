						<h2>NORML is one of the largest and oldest non-profit 
						<br />marijuana activist organizations in the world.
						</h2>
						<p><img src="images/sanorml_logo-2015-green.jpg" width="220" height="180" align="left"`>NORML supports the removal of all criminal penalties for the private possession and responsible use of marijuana by adults. San Antonio NORML has had a presence since 2011. Our local NORML chapter promotes a better understanding of the medical, legal, environmental, and civil libertarian arguments for more reasonable treatments of cannabis laws in Texas and the United States.
						<br /><br />
						We are a 501(c)3 nonprofit and we are completely volunteer run. <img src="images/cannabis_leaf.jpg" height="220" align="right"> All membership dues and donations go toward furthering the movement to make sure the citizens have safe and legal access to whole plant cannabis. As a chapter of the National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws in the 7th largest city in the country, we work closely with our legislators and the state chapter of NORML to make sure the public opinion is being considered when making laws that affect us all. Our purpose is to educate and mobilize citizens who have been affected directly or indirectly by the war on drugs.</p>

					<h3>Current Texas Bills</h3>
					In the state of Texas, the people do not have the ability to vote on drug policy at a local level. Every two years, the elected officials meet at the Capital to write bills, get feedback from constituents, listen to testimony from supporters/opposers of the bills and then vote on bills in the House and the Senate and then finally to pass them. The 2015 legislative session has been one of the most productive sessions in Texas for drug reform EVER! You can find info on the current bills and actions items with the links below.</p>	
					<div class="features-row">

							<h3>Decrim HB-507 / SB-1417</h3>
							<p>In December, we stood by Rep. Joe Moody as he announced the introduction of <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill=HB507" target="_blank" alt="HB-507">HB-507</a>, Texas' first bill to eliminate the arrest, jail time, and criminal record associated with marijuana possession. A companion bill <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill=SB1417" target="_blank" alt="SB-1417">SB-1417</a> has been introduced with the Texas Senate.</p>

							<h3>Medical HB-3785 / SB-1839</h3>
							<p>Rep. Marisa Márquez, D-El Paso, introduced <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill=hb3785" target="_blank" alt="HB-3785">HB-3785</a>, a proposal to bring Texas patients safe and legal access to medical marijuana. This bill also has a companion bill <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/History.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill=sb1839" target="_blank" alt="SB-1839">SB-1839</a> in the Texas Senate.</p>

							<h3>Hemp HB-557 & HB-1322</h3>
							<p>Two bills have been filed for Hemp in Texas by Rep. Joe Farias! <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill=HB557" target="_blank" alt="HB-557">HB-557</a> would allow for the study of industrial hemp within Texas Universities. <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill=HB1322" target="_blank" alt="HB-1322">HB-1322</a> permits the growth and cultivation of industrial hemp on Texas farms.</p>

							<h3>Legalization HB-2165</h3>
							<p>Rep. David Simpson from Longview, introduced <a href="http://www.capitol.state.tx.us/BillLookup/history.aspx?LegSess=84R&Bill=HB2165" target="_blank" alt="HB-2165">HB-2165</a> which will completely repeal marijuana prohibition in Texas. Unlike the decrim bills that amend law to reduce the penalties this bill would strike the current laws from the books entirely. The end result would be that cannabis would be regulated like tomatoes under Texas law.</p>
